[mod-setting-description]
017-drill=(Default enabled) Toggle FFF-266 mining changes (removed hardness). This mod makes all vanilla ore hardness = 1 and makes the burner-mining-drill mining_power = 3, which may break modded ore gating.
017-smelting=(Default enabled) Toggle V's smelting changes (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=64219#p392508). This mod may break ratios for modded recipes using vanilla and modded items.
017-assem-lim=(Default enabled) Toggle the assembly limit removal. This mod affects all assembling-machines and may affect modded crafting stations based on this entity, which may use the limit as a form of gating.
017-old-science=(Default disabled) Toggle the old science recipes (0.16), including LDS. When disabled it removes the ability to use the vanilla science and LDS recipes (except SP 1 & 2) but allows existing crafting machines to continue using the recipe until manually changed.
017-recipes-changes=(Default enabled) atomic-bomb and power-armor-mk2 recipe changes 
017-durability=(Default enabled) All armor now have inf. durability (https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=384185#p384185). Axes also have inf. durability to reflect the removal of mining-tool items.
017-axe=(Default enabled) IMPORTANT NOTE: It is highly recomended that infinite durability is enabled when using this option to prevent duplicate items. Implements the FFF-266 changes as best as possible. Instead of mining-tools being crafted, they are inserted and locked to the player's tool slot when they're researched. The best mining-tool is used over lower speed ones.
017-equipment=(Default enabled) Adds belt-immunity-equipment tech and recipe (FFF-256). Note that if another mod that adds belt-immunity-equipment recipe is present, this mod's unlock will be disabled. Disabling this option in an existing game will NOT remove the item - only the recipe & tech.
017-lds=(Default enabled) low-density-structure is also used in multiple advanced personal equipment recipes (mk2 items, fusion reactor, laser defense) instead of steel (FFF-257). NOTE: the cost values in this mod are NOT official, and won't affect other mods (contact me if you want your modded recipe added.). Where possible the cost = math.ceil(n("steel-plate")/2)
017-lds-num=(Default 5, Min 1, Max 32) When steel-plate is not present in vanilla 'high tech' equipment recipes, the cost is determined by the number of "processing-unit"s. math.ceil(n("processing-unit")/thissetting)
017-pack-type-rebalancing=(Default enabled) Enable the rebalancing of high-end technologies into production/utility 'categories' (FFF-275). For example, level-3 modules no longer use utility science and will use production science instead as they increase production.
017-techtree=(Default enabled) Enable the 0.17 techtree. Science packs are now unlocked by dedicated technologies and the rocket-silo no longer requires rocket-speed-5 as a prerequisite (FFF-275 & FFF-245). NOTE: Technologies are dynamically assigned a 'science pack technology' as a prerequisite through script (to work with mods). This may not reflect release tech paths.
017-nuclear-reprocessing-discount=(Default 1000, Min 0, Max 1400) This number is subtracted from the current cost of nuclear-fuel-reprocessing technology (1500). FFF-275 hints at a major discount to this technology ("The Nuclear fuel cell reprocessing is also drastically cheaper") but does not specify an amount.
017-rocket-victory=(Default enabled) The victory condition for the game no longer requires a payload (satellite) (FFF-275).
017-tank-gun-nerf=(Default enabled) FFF-275 states that the 100% damage bonus the tank machinegun provides will be removed.
